					<h3>Posters</h3>
					<p>
						The poster is to signify a present problem that is happening around us as we speak. The number of accidents occurring due to the excessive use of the handphone is steadily increasing and it is not a good statistic to incur. My poster is trying to promote a cause to reduce or stop the use of handphone at dangerous locations, asking people to look up from their phones and concentrate on the road. 
					</p>

					<h3>App Interface</h3>
					<p>
						The Look Up App is created in the line that people are motivated to try new things if there is a reward that comes together with it. Thus the use of a mobile app that allows people to collect points when they refrain from using their phones while crossing the road. They will eventually be rewarded with vouchers.

					<h3>Touch Points</h3>
					<p>
						Besides the posters, a floor sticker will also be implemented to alert the people of the app and the road ahead. It also reminds the people about the benefits of the app and the direction that the cause is taking. It will be placed near traffic lights and pedestrian crossings as this are the area most affected.

					<h3>Corporate Logo</h3>
					<p>
						The corporate logo is created for a chinese medical hall. Jia Medical Hall is a fictious medical hall and the name is taken from my own name Jia-Wei. The Jia which translate to home symbolises the warmth and comfort that a home could bring to people. The logo is similar to the containers used in traditional medical halls and it also symbolises a roof above people's head.

					<h3>Corporate Stationery</h3>
					<p>
						Every corporation needs corporate stationery to have an identity. Be it namecards, letterheads, notepads, and paper bags. It is also a form of advertising for the company as people will be able to carry it around and feature the brand to the masses.
					</p>

					<h3>Uniforms</h3>
					<p>
						The uniforms protrays the image of the company as it is worn by the front line sales staff of the medical hall. A proper uniform will allow the company to have a level of professionalism, and since it is seen on the front line, it is also a good branding for the company.

					<h1>PRO WRESTLING Magazine</h1>

					<h3>Magazine Front Cover</h3>
					<p>
						This magazine features the lives of pro-wrestlers and what goes on in their lives behind the ring. The magazine talks about the families and friends that comes behind the scene of pro wrestling and it is not as dramatic as seen on the television. 
					</p>

				<div class="col-md-3 project-item col-sm-6  col-xs-10 col-xs-push- col-sm-push-01">
					<img src="images/mag2.jpg" alt="this is my project" class="img-responsive img-circle">
					
					<h3>Center Fold</h3>
					<p>
						Dramatic full images of wrestlers in their element allows for a more impactful imagery for the target audiences. Making use of the center portion of the magazine, it allows the readers to have a clear distinction between the pages and the greyscale colouration is to create a sense of sophistication, unlike the usual pro-wrestling magazine.
					</p>

				<div class="col-md-3 project-item col-sm-6  col-xs-10 col-xs-push- col-sm-push-01">
					<img src="images/mag3.jpg" alt="this is my project" class="img-responsive img-circle">
					
					<h3>Poster</h3>
					<p>
						The poster is used to promote the magazine and the message that it is trying to convey. The image on the poster shows the two sides of a pro-wrestler, mainly his in-ring persona and his duty to his family. It is a comparison of the different live partaken by the pro-wrestler and it allows the audiences to understand the direction of the magazine before reading it.
